This project is an experimentation using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Inteligence to optimise the performance of a traffic light system
ive adopted ML algorithms such as: actor-critic, neural network with online learning, and neural network using a fixed model.
these algorithms are optimised for TinyML
